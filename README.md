# FLETNIX
Is an anagram of... *you knew it
The Android Native Application.

## Tech Stacks :
- Kotlin
- AndroidX
- ViewBinding
- Hilt (Dependency Injection)
- MVVM Pattern
- Retrofit
- etc.

It's not for commercial purpose, just rewritting the new codes with [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API, the things that we knew for practice.
I wrote this code, prefer for better project structure, clean code, refering SOLID principles and be more following best practices of writting Android Native Application. Don't asking why the UI is too simple and nothing special :)
